A website listing minecraft modded servers and their status.

    Its made with: NextJS, TailwindCSS and SCSS.

## Usage

1. Visit the website at [MMSL](https://minecraftmoddedservers.vercel.app), here you can browse all servers.
2. Navigate to the /type route to get a list of available server types, and getting a sorted list.
3. Browse through the list of servers and click on the ones that interest you.
4. Visit the server's website or join page to learn more about it.

## Contributing

I welcome any contributions to this website. If you want to make any change, please feel free to open a pull request on the GitHub repository.

Also because this was a side project, so **I'm not**(probably) going to spend time implenting databases for a voting system or user authentication.
